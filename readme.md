# Chladni Pattern Simulation
This project simulates Chladni figures, which are visual patterns formed by vibrating plates.

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pyqt6 pygame-ce
```

## Usage
- Run `show_patterns.py` to view patterns.
- Run `simulate_plate.py` to start an interactive simulation.

## Reference
Based on **Chladni Figures and the Tacoma Bridge: Motivating PDE Eigenvalue Problems via Vibrating Plates** by **Martin J. Gander and Felix Kwok**.
